The crucial message of this chapter — the concept of model predictive control (MPC) — has been described in a number of dedicated monographs and textbooks. Particularly recommendable are [@rawlingsModelPredictiveControl2017] and [@borrelliPredictiveControlLinear2017]. They are not only reasonably up-to-date, written by leaders in the field, but they are also available online.

Some updates as well as additional tutorial are in [@rakovicHandbookModelPredictive2019], which seems to be available to CTU students through the [institutional access](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/cvut/detail.action?docID=5504961).

There seems to be no shortage of lecture notes and slides as well. Particularly recommendable are the course slides [@bemporadModelPredictiveControl2021a] and [@boydModelPredictiveControl].

Extensions towards nonlinear systems are described in [@gruneNonlinearModelPredictive2017], which also seems to be available to CTU students through the [institutional access](https://cvut.summon.serialssolutions.com/#!/search?bookMark=eNqFkUtPwzAQhA0URFr6AzggVb0gDqF-JbGPUJWHVMEFcbUc22lDQ1xsp_x93AZx5biab0a7s0Mwll1YmzbUSgajAbhE8BZBWMx4wVKSEsRTmkNM0_wIDEkcDxM-BglGvEgLhPhJLzBCMUEDkEAUrRnJ6BlIeI6LDDKOz8HY-w8Io5hjWKAETF9s29StkW7yabVpJltndK1CvTMTZdvgbHMBTivZeDMGg-A6MwLvD4u3-VO6fH18nt8tU0lggVla8kqpjLOSxWhNKoxIqaqq1JQZU5WVolrpnGhGFUKGasmqkjIc3UyznOZkBK76YLXrgohNyMauRFyW4XgWwyNw0-vSb8y3X9smeLFrTGntxovY1F8xeWRnPeu3rm5XxomeQlDse93TgojIi4NB7B3XvWPr7FdnfBCHYBW_4mQjFvdzWlDIMxTJ6e-e0svYXS0-bWtXTm7XXmTxEEgy_N8xPxJ1iPU).

Since MPC essentially boils down to solving optimization problems in real time on some industrial device, the topic of embedded optimization is important. Nice overview is given in [@ferreauEmbeddedOptimizationMethods2017].
