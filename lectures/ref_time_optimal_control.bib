Universal curves have been obtained using the theory that exhibits relationships between dimensionless quantities. The curves enable designers to choose appropriate actuator performance parameters to meet design objectives. Experimental methods have been described to determine some of the important parameters involved in the theory.}

The proposed method specifically minimizes the settling time of the servo positioning system by applying a constant feed-forward signal at the initial time. Unlike many other time-optimal control algorithms, additional computation is not needed once the constant optimal control signal is applied. Since the control is achieved through a constant change in the system's initial condition, the overall stability of the original control system is not affected by the addition of the time-optimal controller. The proposed control scheme has been implemented on a 3.5" disk drive servo system with a rotary actuator. Significant improvement in seeking time has been demonstrated by both simulation and experiments.}

  abstract = {The proximate time-optimal servomechanism (PTOS) is widely used in hard disk drives because of its simplicity and good performance. There have been many studies to improve PTOSs, though they are complex or need a time-consuming tuning process. Here, we propose a novel damping scheduling PTOS (DSPTOS) for hard disk drives. The proposed algorithm keeps the closed-loop damping coefficient at a predetermined value. Compared to the original PTOS, smaller damping in deceleration will boost the rising speed, and larger damping in the settling phase reduces the overshoot and residual vibrations. Moreover, the DSPTOS maintains the simplicity of the PTOS by introducing just a predetermined damping coefficient. We applied the proposed DSPTOS algorithm to a voice coil motor in a hard disk drive. Through simulations and real-time experiments, we verified the effectiveness of the DSPTOS. In particular, with respect to long stroke seeks, the DSPTOS performs better than the PTOS.}

Theorems stating sufficient conditions on each system's control design parameters to ensure global stability are given, and it is shown that the control parameters can be adjusted to accommodate, more or less, disturbances and unmodeled dynamics in the system. The approach used to develop the controllers is that of constructing a 'slab' in three-dimensional state space that describe the 'switching' structure of the control.

  abstract = {Conventionally, robot control algorithms are divided into two stages, namely, path or trajectory planning and path tracking (or path control). This division has been adopted mainly as a means of alleviating difficulties in dealing with complex, coupled manipulator dynamics. Trajectory planning usually determines the timing of manipulator position and velocity without considering its dynamics. Consequently, the simplicity obtained from the division comes at the expense of efficiency in utilizing robot's capabilities. To remove at least partially this inefficiency, this paper considers a solution to the problem of moving a manipulator in minimum time along a specified geometric path subject to input torque/force constraints. We first describe the manipulator dynamics using parametric functions which represent geometric path constraints to be honored for collision avoidance as well as task requirements. Second, constraints on input torques/ forces are converted to those on the parameters. Third, the minimum-time solution is deduced in an algorithm form using phase-plane techniques. Finally, numerical examples are presented to demonstrate utility of the trajectory planning method developed.}

Comparison studies were made against the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) optimal control strategy. Experimental results show that the LQG control algorithm helps to reduce the energy of the PES, but does not help to reduce the maximum error signal.

This leads to the problem of mode switching among these controllers. We present in this paper a unified control scheme, the discrete-time composite nonlinear feedback control, which can perform all the above functions in hard disk drive (HDD) servo systems with actuator saturation. The proposed scheme is composed by combining a linear feedback law and a nonlinear feedback law. The linear feedback law is designed to yield a fast response, while the nonlinear feedback law is used to increase the damping ratio of the closed-loop system as the system output approaches the command input. In the face of actuator saturation, this control law not only increases the speed of closed-loop response, but also improves the settling performance. Implementation results show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional proximate time-optimal servomechanism by about 30\% in settling time.}

With strong observability as the key tool, analogous conditions are derived for problems subject to both extrinsic and intrinsic state constraints. Understanding these geometric properties enables exact convex relaxations. The relaxation technique is used to convert a nonconvex quadratic program to a second-order cone program and a mixed integer linear program to a linear program. The relaxations accelerate numerical solution times by factors of 18 000 and 150, respectively. As such, the theorems and relaxations are seen as important tools for real-time optimization-based control.}
