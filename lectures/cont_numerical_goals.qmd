## Knowledge (remember and understand)

- Enumerate numerical method for indirect approach to continuous-time optimal control (gradient method, shooting, multiple shooting, collocation). Explain the essence of individual methods.
- Enumerate numerical method for indirect approach to continuous-time optimal control (direct shooting, direct multiple shooting, direct collocation). Explain the essence of individual methods.

## Skills (use the knowledge to solve a problem)

- Solve a continuous-time optimal control problem for a nonlinear system using a direct method (at least using the method of direct collocation).
