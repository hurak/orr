  abstract = {Although nonlinear model predictive control has become a well-established control approach, its application to time-critical systems requiring fast feedback is still a major computational challenge. In this article we investigate a new multi-level iteration scheme based on theory and algorithmic ideas from [2], and extending the idea of real-time iterations as presented in [4]. This novel approach takes into account the natural hierarchy of different time scales inherent in the dynamic model. Applications from aerodynamics and chemical engineering have been successfully treated. In this contribution we apply the investigated multi-level iteration scheme to fast optimal control of a vehicle and discuss the computational performance of the scheme.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a decentralized model predictive control (DMPC) scheme for large-scale dynamical processes subject to input constraints. The global model of the process is approximated as the decomposition of several (possibly overlapping) smaller models used for local predictions. The degree of decoupling among submodels represents a tuning knob of the approach: the less coupled are the submodels, the lighter the computational burden and the load for transmission of shared information; but the smaller is the degree of cooperativeness of the decentralized controllers and the overall performance of the control system. Sufficient criteria for analyzing asymptotic closed-loop stability are provided for input constrained open-loop asymptotically stable systems and for unconstrained open-loop unstable systems, under possible intermittent lack of communication of measurement data between controllers. The DMPC approach is also extended to asymptotic tracking of output set-points and rejection of constant measured disturbances. The effectiveness of the approach is shown on a relatively large-scale simulation example on decentralized temperature control based on wireless sensor feedback.},

The tested controllers are centralized and decentralized model predictive controllers schemes for tracking and several distributed MPC schemes based on (i) cooperative game theory, (ii) sensivity-based coordination mechanisms, (iii) bargaining game theory, and (iv) serial decomposition of the centralized problem. In order to analyze the controllers, a control test is proposed and a number of performance indices are defined.

This provides one way of leveraging and combining the advantages of model-free and model-based approaches. Specifically, we differentiate through MPC by using the KKT conditions of the convex approximation at a fixed point of the controller. Using this strategy, we are able to learn the cost and dynamics of a controller via end-to-end learning. Our experiments focus on imitation learning in the pendulum and cartpole domains, where we learn the cost and dynamics terms of an MPC policy class. We show that our MPC policies are significantly more data-efficient than a generic neural network and that our method is superior to traditional system identification in a setting where the expert is unrealizable.},

  abstract = {The tunnel-following nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme allows to exploit acceptable deviations around a path reference. This is done by using convex-over-nonlinear functions as objective and constraints in the underlying optimal control problem (OCP). The convex-over-nonlinear structure is exploited by algorithms such as the generalized Gauss-Newton (GGN) method or the sequential convex quadratic programming (SCQP) method to reduce the computational complexity of the OCP solution. However, the modeling effort and engineering time required to implement these methods is high. We address the problem of reducing the modeling effort in the implementation of SCQP, focusing on a standard sequential quadratic programming (SQP) implementation where symbolic linearization is applied to the nonlinear part of the convex-over-nonlinear functions in the objective and constraints. The novelty of this letter is twofold. It introduces a novel operator that applies symbolic linearization in a transparent and easy way to solve nonconvex OCPs with the SCQP method, and introduces a meaningful representation of an orientation-tunnel for robotic applications by means of a convex-over-nonlinear constraint, which preserves the convexity exploitation by the SCQP method. The proposed technique is demonstrated in a tunnel-following task for a 7-degrees-of-freedom manipulator.}

In high performance solvers for MPC, this is performed using Riccati recursions or generic sparsity exploiting algorithms. To be able to get this performance gain, the problem has to be formulated in a sparse way which introduces more variables. The alternative is to use a smaller formulation where the objective function Hessian is dense. In this work, it is shown that it is possible to exploit the structure also when using the dense formulation. More specifically, it is shown that it is possible to efficiently compute a standard Cholesky factorization for the dense formulation. This results in a computational complexity that grows quadratically in the prediction horizon length instead of cubically as for the generic Cholesky factorization.},

One leading to a sparse linear system of equations involving relatively many variables to compute in each iteration and another one leading to a dense linear system of equations involving relatively few variables. In this work, it is shown that it is possible not only to consider these two distinct choices of formulations. Instead it is shown that it is possible to create an entire family of formulations with different levels of sparsity and number of variables, and that this extra degree of freedom can be exploited to obtain even better performance with the software and hardware at hand. This result also provides a better answer to a recurring question in MPC; should the sparse or dense formulation be used.},

Robustness is achieved by introducing an outer proximal-point iteration scheme that regularizes the problem without altering the solution, and by adaptively weighting the least squares problems encountered while solving the problem. The performance of the resulting QP solver in terms of speed and robustness in the single precision arithmetic is assessed against other optimization algorithms tailored to embedded model predictive control applications.}

With a simple, unified approach, and with attention to real-time implementation, it covers predictive control theory including the stability, feasibility, and robustness of MPC controllers. The theory of explicit MPC, where the nonlinear optimal feedback controller can be calculated efficiently, is presented in the context of linear systems with linear constraints, switched linear systems, and, more generally, linear hybrid systems. Drawing upon years of practical experience and using numerous examples and illustrative applications, the authors discuss the techniques required to design predictive control laws, including algorithms for polyhedral manipulations, mathematical and multiparametric programming and how to validate the theoretical properties and to implement predictive control policies. The most important algorithms feature in an accompanying free online MATLAB toolbox, which allows easy access to sample solutions. Predictive Control for Linear and Hybrid Systems is an ideal reference for graduate, postgraduate and advanced control practitioners interested in theory and/or implementation aspects of predictive control.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the distributed model predictive control (MPC) of nonlinear large-scale systems with dynamically decoupled subsystems. According to the coupled state in the overall cost function of centralized MPC, the neighbors are confirmed and fixed for each subsystem, and the overall objective function is disassembled into each local optimization. In order to guarantee the closed-loop stability of distributed MPC algorithm, the overall compatibility constraint for centralized MPC algorithm is decomposed into each local controller. The communication between each subsystem and its neighbors is relatively low, only the current states before optimization and the optimized input variables after optimization are being transferred. For each local controller, the quasi-infinite horizon MPC algorithm is adopted, and the global closed-loop system is proven to be exponentially stable. This paper presents a novel decentralised model predictive control for a plant consisting of interconnected systems. A constructive technique for online stabilisation that is applicable to the model predictive controllers (MPC) is developed. The plant-wise stability is achievable by the newly introduced asymptotically positive realness constraint (APRC) for MPC. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the presented APRC.},

  abstract = {This book presents general methods for the design of economic model predictive control (EMPC) systems for broad classes of nonlinear systems that address key theoretical and practical considerations including recursive feasibility, closed-loop stability, closed-loop performance, and computational efficiency.  Specifically, the book proposes: Lyapunov-based EMPC methods for nonlinear systems;  two-tier EMPC architectures that are highly computationally efficient; and  EMPC schemes handling explicitly uncertainty, time-varying cost functions, time-delays and multiple-time-scale dynamics. The proposed methods employ a variety of tools ranging from nonlinear systems analysis, through Lyapunov-based control techniques to nonlinear dynamic optimization. The applicability and performance of the proposed methods are demonstrated through a number of chemical process examples. The book presents state-of-the-art methods for the design of economic model predictive control systems for chemical processes.In addition to being mathematically rigorous, these methods accommodate key practical issues, for example, direct optimization of process economics, time-varying economic cost functions and computational efficiency. Numerous comments and remarks providing fundamental understanding of the merging of process economics and feedback control into a single framework are included. A control engineer can easily tailor the many detailed examples of industrial relevance given within the text to a specific application. The authors present a rich collection of new research topics and references to significant recent work making Economic Model Predictive Control an important source of information and inspiration for academics and graduate students researching the area and for process engineers interested in applying its ideas.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the model predictive control (MPC) strategy is utilized in smart homes to handle the optimal operation of controllable electrical loads of residential end-users. In the proposed model, active consumers reduce their daily electricity bills by installing photovoltaic (PV) panels and battery electrical energy storage (BEES) units. The optimal control strategy will be determined by the home energy management system (HEMS), benefiting from the meteorological and electricity market data stream during the operation horizon. In this case, the optimal scheduling of home appliances is managed using the shrinking horizon MPC (SH-MPC) and the main objective is to minimize the electricity cost. To this end, the HEMS is augmented by the SH-MPC, while maintaining the desired operation time slots of controllable loads for each day. The HEMS is cast as a standard mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that is incorporated into the SH-MPC framework. The functionality of the proposed method is investigated under different scenarios applied to a benchmark system while both time-of-use (TOU) and real-time pricing (RTP) mechanisms have been adopted in this study. The problem is solved using six case studies. In this regard, the impact of the TOU tariff was assessed in Scenarios 1--3 while Scenarios 4--6 evaluate the problem with the RTP mechanism. By adopting the TOU tariff and without any load shifting program, the cost is {$<$}inline-formula{$>$} {$<$}tex-math notation="LaTeX"{$>\$\$$} \$ {$<$}/tex-math{$><$}/inline-formula{$>$}1.2274 while by using the load shifting program without the PV and BEES system, the cost would reduce to {$<$}inline-formula{$>$} {$<$}tex-math notation="LaTeX"{$>\$\$$} \$ {$<$}/tex-math{$><$}/inline-formula{$>$}0.8709. Furthermore, by using the SH-MPC model, PV system and the BEES system, the cost would reduce to {$<$}inline-formula{$>$} {$<$}tex-math notation="LaTeX"{$>\$\$$} \$ {$<$}/tex-math{$><$}/inline-formula{$>$}-0.282713 with the TOU tariff. This issue shows that the prosumer would be able to make a profit.

The control objective is to satisfy a given STL specification with high probability against stochastic uncertainties while maximizing the robust satisfaction of an STL specification with minimum control effort. We formulate a general solution, which does not require precise knowledge of probability distributions of (possibly dependent) stochastic disturbances; only the bounded support of the density functions and moment intervals are used. For the specific case of disturbances that are normally distributed, we optimize the controllers by utilizing knowledge of the probability distribution of the disturbance. We show that in both cases, the control law can be obtained by solving optimization problems with linear constraints at each step. We experimentally demonstrate effectiveness of this approach by synthesizing a controller for a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system.}

The new technique features a shrinking horizon, rather than the most common receding one, and an input parametrization strategy to reduce computational burden. The property of transferability of the parametrization strategy is introduced. Under this property, theoretical convergence guarantees in nominal conditions are obtained by construction. Two relaxed techniques are then proposed to retain recursive feasibility in presence of bounded additive input disturbance. A bound on the constraint violation achieved by these relaxed techniques as a function of the uncertainty bound is derived, too. The developed strategy is applied to the problem of energy-efficient operation of trains, in either a fully autonomous mode (with continuous input values) or a driver assistance mode (with discrete input values, resulting in a nonlinear integer program if no parametrization is used). Realistic simulation results in this context illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

  abstract = {Starting in the late 1970s, optimization-based control has built up an impressive track record of successful industrial applications, in particular in the petrochemical and process industries. More recently, optimization methods for automatic control are more and more deployed on so-called embedded hardware to cater for application-specific needs such as guaranteed communication latency, low energy consumption or cost effectiveness. This development greatly broadens the scope of applications to which optimization methods can be applied to sectors such as robotics, automotive, aerospace or power electronics. However, it also poses additional challenges regarding both the algorithmic concepts and their actual implementations for a given computing hardware. This survey paper discusses key challenges for using embedded optimization methods and summarizes their main use cases in current industrial practice. Motivated by this discussion, a number of dedicated embedded optimization algorithms and their actual implementations are reviewed. The presentation is organized according to the mathematical structure of the embedded optimization problem, ranging from convex quadratic programming over more general convex and nonconvex problems to formulations comprising discrete optimization variables.},

  abstract = {Many practical applications lead to optimization problems that can either be stated as quadratic programming (QP) problems or require the solution of QP problems on a lower algorithmic level. One relatively recent approach to solve QP problems are parametric active-set methods that are based on tracing the solution along a linear homotopy between a QP problem with known solution and the QP problem to be solved. This approach seems to make them particularly suited for applications where a-priori information can be used to speed-up the QP solution or where high solution accuracy is required. In this paper we describe the open-source C++ software package qpOASES, which implements a parametric active-set method in a reliable and efficient way. Numerical tests show that qpOASES can outperform other popular academic and commercial QP solvers on small- to medium-scale convex test examples of the Maros-M{\'e}sz{\'a}ros QP collection. Moreover, various interfaces to third-party software packages make it easy to use, even on embedded computer hardware. Finally, we describe how qpOASES can be used to compute critical points of nonconvex QP problems.},

While standard control techniques lead to continuous movements of all actuators, this approach enables a selected subset of actuators to be used, the others being brought into play in exceptional circumstances. The same approach can also be used to obtain asynchronous actuator interventions, so that control actions are only taken in response to large disturbances. This thesis presents a straightforward and systematic approach to achieving these practical properties, which are ignored by mainstream control theory.},

A novel model predictive control scheme is proposed that keeps the motor torque, the stator flux, and (if present) the inverter's neutral point potential within given hysteresis bounds while minimizing the switching frequency of the inverter. Based on an internal model of the drive, the controller predictsseveralfuture switch transitions, extrapolates the output trajectories, and chooses the sequence of inverter switch positions (voltage vectors) that minimizes the switching frequency. The advantages of the proposed controller are twofold. First, as underlined by the experimental results in the second part of this paper, it yields a superior performance with respect to the industrial state of the art. Specifically, the switching frequency is reduced by up to 50\% while the torque and flux are kept more accurately within their bounds. Moreover, the fast dynamic torque response is inherited from standard DTC. Second, the scheme is applicable to a large class of (three-phase) AC electric machines driven by inverters.}

Moreover, DTC's favorable dynamic and robustness properties are preserved. This paper presents an MPDTC scheme for a permanent magnet synchronous motor that achieves long prediction horizons in the range of up to 150 time-steps through the use of extrapolation and bounds.

Simulation results for a three-level voltage source inverter indicate that such an MPDTC scheme, compared to an industry standard controller, is capable of reducing the switching losses and the switching frequency by up to 50\%, and the torque THD by 25\%, while leaving the current THD unchanged.}

However, such terminal constraints fail to enforce strong feasibility in a rich class of MPC problems, for example when employing move-blocking. In this paper a generalized, least restrictive approach for enforcing strong feasibility of MPC problems is proposed and applied to move-blocking MPC. The approach hinges on the novel concept of controlled invariant feasibility. Instead of a terminal constraint, the state of an earlier prediction step is constrained to a controlled invariant feasible set. Controlled invariant feasibility is a generalization of controlled invariance. The convergence of well-known approaches for determining maximum controlled invariant sets, and j-step admissible sets, is formally proved. Thus an algorithm for rigorously approximating maximum controlled invariant feasible sets is developed for situations where the exact maximum cannot be determined.},

  abstract = {A model predictive control (MPC) framework with a fixed maneuver horizon and shrinking prediction and control horizons is presented that, at each time step, minimizes the most accurate prediction of a complete cost for a discrete linear system, subject to constraints. Methods of weight selection to ensure strong convexity of the cost, which makes the quadratic programming problem associated with MPC numerically more tractable, are discussed. A continuous-time flexible-blade helicopter dynamic model is discretized, and the resulting model is used to demonstrate this control design method in ship landing and touchdown maneuvers. Inequality constraints, ship-induced turbulence, and parametric uncertainty are gradually included in the design and analysis. Several case studies are used to illustrate the effectiveness of this control method in landings on ships that experience quiescent and nonquiescent motions.}

  abstract = {Linear model predictive control (MPC) can be currently deployed at outstanding speeds, thanks to recent progress in algorithms for solving online the underlying structured quadratic programs. In contrast, nonlinear MPC (NMPC) requires the deployment of more elaborate algorithms, which require longer computation times than linear MPC. Nonetheless, computational speeds for NMPC comparable to those of MPC are now regularly reported, provided that the adequate algorithms are used. In this paper, we aim at clarifying the similarities and differences between linear MPC and NMPC. In particular, we focus our analysis on NMPC based on the real-time iteration (RTI) scheme, as this technique has been successfully tested and, in some applications, requires computational times that are only marginally larger than linear MPC. The goal of the paper is to promote the understanding of RTI-based NMPC within the linear MPC community.}

  abstract = {This book offers readers a thorough and rigorous introduction to nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) for discrete-time and sampled-data systems. NMPC schemes with and without stabilizing terminal constraints are detailed, and intuitive examples illustrate the performance of different NMPC variants. NMPC is interpreted as an approximation of infinite-horizon optimal control so that important properties like closed-loop stability, inverse optimality and suboptimality can be derived in a uniform manner. These results are complemented by discussions of feasibility and robustness.  An introduction to nonlinear optimal control algorithms yields essential insights into how the nonlinear optimization routine---the core of any nonlinear model predictive controller---works. Accompanying software in MATLAB{\textregistered} and C++ (downloadable from extras.springer.com/), together with an explanatory appendix in the book itself, enables readers to perform computer experiments exploring the possibilities and limitations of NMPC. The second edition has been substantially rewritten, edited and updated to reflect the significant advances that have been made since the publication of its predecessor, including: {$\bullet$} a new chapter on economic NMPC relaxing the assumption that the running cost penalizes the distance to a pre-defined equilibrium; {$\bullet$} a new chapter on distributed NMPC discussing methods which facilitate the control of large-scale systems by splitting up the optimization into smaller subproblems; {$\bullet$} an extended discussion of stability and performance using approximate updates rather than full optimization; {$\bullet$} replacement of the pivotal sufficient condition for stability without stabilizing terminal conditions with a weaker alternative and inclusion of an alternative and much simpler proof in the analysis; and {$\bullet$} further variations and extensions in response to suggestions from readers of the first edition. Though primarily aimed at academic researchers and practitioners working in control and optimization, the text is self-contained, featuring background material on infinite-horizon optimal control and Lyapunov stability theory that also makes it accessible for graduate students in control engineering and applied mathematics.},

The interaction between the cost function and the treatment of minimum impulse bit is also investigated. The propellant consumption with {$\ell$}asso MPC for the considered scenario is noticeably less than with a conventional quadratic cost and control actions are sparser in time. Propellant consumption and sparsity are competitive with those achieved using a zone-based {$\ell$}1 cost function, whilst requiring fewer decision variables in the optimisation problem than the latter. The {$\ell$}asso MPC is demonstrated to meet tighter specifications on control precision and also avoids the risk of undesirable behaviours often associated with pure {$\ell$}1 stage costs.}

Model predictive control (MPC), as the prime methodology for constrained control, offers a significant opportunity to exploit the abundance of data in a reliable manner, particularly while taking safety constraints into account. This review aims at summarizing and categorizing previous research on learning-based MPC, i.e., the integration or combination of MPC with learning methods, for which we consider three main categories. Most of the research addresses learning for automatic improvement of the prediction model from recorded data. There is, however, also an increasing interest in techniques to infer the parameterization of the MPC controller, i.e., the cost and constraints, that lead to the best closed-loop performance. Finally, we discuss concepts that leverage MPC to augment learning-based controllers with constraint satisfaction properties.}

The complexity of such analytic formulations of the control law can grow exponentially with the prediction horizon.

In the present paper a piecewise quadratic (PWQ) Lyapunov function is used for the stability verification of an of approximate explicit Model Predictive Control (MPC). A novel relaxation method is proposed for the LMI criteria on the Lyapunov function design.

However, to simplify the design, researchers frequently make choices that-often unknowingly-reduce the system performance. In this article, we discuss and analyze the factors that affect the closed-loop performance of FCS-MPC. Based on these findings, design guidelines are provided that help to maximize the system performance. To highlight the performance benefits, two case studies will be considered: the first one consists of a two-level converter and an induction machine, whereas the second one adds an LC filter between the converter and the machine.}

The design procedure depends on the type of lower-level controller involved and four practical cases are covered:PID lower-level controllers;linear quadratic regulators;relay-based controllers; andcases where the lower-level controllers are themselves model predictive controllers.For each case the authors provide a thorough theoretical derivation of the corresponding reference governor, followed by illustrative examples.The second part of the book is devoted to practical aspects of MPC-based reference governor schemes. Experimental and simulation case studies from four applications are discussed in depth:control of a power generation unit;temperature control in buildings;stabilization of objects in a magnetic field; andvehicle convoy control.Each chapter includes precise mathematical formulations of the corresponding MPC-based governor, reformulation of the control problem into an optimization problem, and a detailed presentation and comparison of results.The case studies and practical considerations of constraints will help control engineers working in various industries in the use of MPC at the supervisory level.

Moving on to robust predictive control, the text explains how similar guarantees may be obtained for cases in which the model describing the system dynamics is subject to additive disturbances and parametric uncertainties. Open- and closed-loop optimization are considered and the state of the art in computationally tractable methods based on uncertainty tubes presented for systems with additive model uncertainty. Finally, the tube framework is also applied to model predictive control problems involving hard or probabilistic constraints for the cases of multiplicative and stochastic model uncertainty. The book provides: extensive use of illustrative examples; sample problems; and discussion of novel control applications such as resource allocation for sustainable development and turbine-blade control for maximized power capture with simultaneously reduced risk of turbulence-induced damage. Graduate students pursuing courses in model predictive control or more generally in advanced or process control and senior undergraduates in need of a specialized treatment will find Model Predictive Control an invaluable guide to the state of the art in this important subject.

Introducing such parametrization leads indeed to two potential benefits: a) reducing the number of optimization variables, and b) enabling enforcing constraints on the vehicles in a computationally efficient way. Moreover, the proposed solution formulates the formation path-following problem as a distributed optimization problem that may then be solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The paper then analyzes the effectiveness of the proposed method via numerical simulations with surface vehicles and differential drive robots.},

The current implementation targets problem families that can be transformed, using disciplined convex programming techniques, to convex quadratic programs of modest size. CVXGEN generates simple, flat, library-free code suitable for embedding in real-time applications. The generated code is almost branch free, and so has highly predictable run-time behavior. The combination of regularization (both static and dynamic) and iterative refinement in the search direction computation yields reliable performance, even with poor quality data.

A designer specifies the RHC controller by specifying the objective, constraints, prediction method, and horizon, each of which has a natural choice suggested directly by the application. In more traditional approaches, such as PID control, a designer tunes the controller coefficients, often using trial and error, to handle the objectives and constraints indirectly. In contrast, RHC con trollers can often obtain good performance with little tuning. In addition to the straightforward design process, we have seen that RHC controllers can be implemented in real time at kilohertz sampling rates. These speeds are useful for both real-time implementation of the controller as well as rapid Monte Carlo simulation for design and testing purposes. Thus, receding horizon control can no longer be considered a slow, computationally intensive policy. Indeed, RHC can be applied to a wide range of control problems, including applications involving fast dynamics.}

  abstract = {Model predictive control is a form of control in which the current control action is obtained by solving, at each sampling instant, a finite horizon open-loop optimal control problem, using the current state of the plant as the initial state; the optimization yields an optimal control sequence and the first control in this sequence is applied to the plant. An important advantage of this type of control is its ability to cope with hard constraints on controls and states. It has, therefore, been widely applied in petro-chemical and related industries where satisfaction of constraints is particularly important because efficiency demands operating points on or close to the boundary of the set of admissible states and controls. In this review, we focus on model predictive control of constrained systems, both linear and nonlinear and discuss only briefly model predictive control of unconstrained nonlinear and/or time-varying systems. We concentrate our attention on research dealing with stability and optimality; in these areas the subject has developed, in our opinion, to a stage where it has achieved sufficient maturity to warrant the active interest of researchers in nonlinear control. We distill from an extensive literature essential principles that ensure stability and use these to present a concise characterization of most of the model predictive controllers that have been proposed in the literature. In some cases the finite horizon optimal control problem solved on-line is exactly equivalent to the same problem with an infinite horizon; in other cases it is equivalent to a modified infinite horizon optimal control problem. In both situations, known advantages of infinite horizon optimal control accrue.},

The issues of feasibility of the on-line optimization, stability and performance are largely understood for systems described by linear models. Much progress has been made on these issues for non-linear systems but for practical applications many questions remain, including the reliability and efficiency of the on-line computation scheme. To deal with model uncertainty `rigorously' an involved dynamic programming problem must be solved. The approximation techniques proposed for this purpose are largely at a conceptual stage. Among the broader research needs the following areas are identified: multivariable system identification, performance monitoring and diagnostics, non-linear state estimation, and batch system control. Many practical problems like control objective prioritization and symptom-aided diagnosis can be integrated systematically and effectively into the MPC framework by expanding the problem formulation to include integer variables yielding a mixed-integer quadratic or linear program. Efficient techniques for solving these problems are becoming available.},

In so-called exact ca-MPC, we adapt the imposed constraints by removing, at each time-step, a subset of the state constraints in order to reduce the computational complexity of the receding-horizon optimal control problem, while ensuring that the closed-loop behavior is identical to that of the original MPC law. We also propose an approximate ca-MPC scheme in which a further reduction of computation time can be accomplished by a tradeoff with closed-loop performance, while still preserving recursive feasibility, stability, and constraint satisfaction properties. The online constraint removal exploits fast backward and forward reachability computations combined with optimality properties.}

In conjunction with decomposition type or branch-and-bound type approaches, the proposed solution strategy first creates affine relaxations of nonconvex critical regions that result from the comparison of two quadratic objective functions. These relaxations are then used to generate an affine outer approximation for the critical regions. Upon termination, the bounded space of the initial states is partitioned into possibly nonconvex critical regions and corresponding optimal control laws.},

  abstract = {The goal of most current advanced control systems is to guide a process to a target setpoint rapidly and reliably. Model predictive control has become a popular technology in many applications because it can handle large, multivariable systems subject to hard constraints on states and inputs. The optimal steady-state setpoint is usually provided by some other information management system that determines, among all steady states, which is the most profitable. For an increasing number of applications, however, this hierarchical separation of information and purpose is no longer optimal or desirable. A recently proposed alternative to the hierarchical decomposition is to take the economic objective directly as the objective function of the control system. In this approach, known as economic MPC, the controller optimizes directly in real time the economic performance of the process, rather than tracking to a setpoint. The purpose of this tutorial is to explain how to design these kinds of control systems and what kinds of closed-loop properties one can achieve with them. We cover the following issues: asymptotic average performance; closed-loop stability and convergence, strong duality and dissipativity; designing terminal costs, terminal regions, and terminal periodic constraints. Several examples are included to illustrate these results.}

Both warm- and cold-starting techniques are analyzed and an illustrative example confirms that small, practical bounds can be obtained that together with the algorithmic and numerical simplicity of fast gradient methods allow online optimization at high rates.}

Moreover, in presence of variations in the operating conditions, the model should be continuously refined to compensate for dynamics changes. In this article, we present a self-supervised learning approach that actively models the dynamics of nonlinear robotic systems. We combine offline learning from past experience and online learning from current robot interaction with the unknown environment. These two ingredients enable a highly sample-efficient and adaptive learning process, capable of accurately inferring model dynamics in real-time even in operating regimes that greatly differ from the training distribution. Moreover, we design an uncertainty-aware model predictive controller that is heuristically conditioned to the aleatoric (data) uncertainty of the learned dynamics. This controller actively chooses the optimal control actions that i) optimize the control performance, and ii) improve the efficiency of online learning sample collection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a series of challenging real-world experiments using a quadrotor system. Our approach showcases high resilience and generalization capabilities by consistently adapting to unseen flight conditions, while it significantly outperforms classical and adaptive control baselines.11Video: https://youtu.be/QmEhSTcWob4}

Our approach is to leverage recent results in contraction theory together with tools from convex optimization to devise ancillary feedback controllers that (a) enjoy quantifiable bounds for the state tube, (b) provide exponential convergence, and (c) fully exploit the nonlinearity of a system, thereby minimizing conservatism. We present a number of methods to design contraction-based ancillary feedback controllers, along with numerical results corroborating our analytical insights.},

  abstract = {We describe a heuristic control policy for a general finite-horizon stochastic control problem, which can be used when the current process disturbance is not conditionally independent of the previous disturbances, given the current state. At each time step, we approximate the distribution of future disturbances (conditioned on what has been observed) by a product distribution with the same marginals. We then carry out dynamic programming (DP), using this modified future disturbance distribution, to find an optimal policy, and in particular, the optimal current action. We then execute only the optimal current action. At the next step, we update the conditional distribution, and repeat the process, this time with a horizon reduced by one step. (This explains the name `shrinking-horizon dynamic programming'). We explain how the method can be thought of as an extension of model predictive control, and illustrate our method on two variations on a revenue management problem.

  abstract = {Completely centralized control of large, networked systems is impractical. Completely decentralized control of such systems, on the other hand, frequently results in unacceptable control performance. In this article, a distributed MPC framework with guaranteed feasibility and nominal stability properties is described. All iterates generated by the proposed distributed MPC algorithm are feasible and the distributed controller, defined by terminating the algorithm at any intermediate iterate, stabilizes the closed-loop system. The above two features allow the practitioner to terminate the distributed MPC algorithm at the end of the sampling interval, even if convergence is not attained. Further, the distributed MPC framework achieves optimal systemwide performance (centralized control) at convergence. Feasibility, stability and optimality properties for the described distributed MPC framework are established. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.},

We assume the switching instances are not known a priori, but instantly at the moment of switching. We first characterize dwell-times that ensure feasible and stable switching between independently designed robust MPC controllers by means of the well established exponential stability result available in the MPC literature. Then, we employ the concept of multiset invariance to improve on our previous results, and obtain an exponential stability guarantee for the switching closed-loop dynamics. The theoretical findings are illustrated via a numerical example.}

  abstract = {A widely recognized shortcoming of model predictive control (MPC) is that it can usually only be used in applications with slow dynamics, where the sample time is measured in seconds or minutes. A well-known technique for implementing fast MPC is to compute the entire control law offline, in which case the online controller can be implemented as a lookup table. This method works well for systems with small state and input dimensions (say, no more than five), few constraints, and short time horizons. In this paper, we describe a collection of methods for improving the speed of MPC, using online optimization. These custom methods, which exploit the particular structure of the MPC problem, can compute the control action on the order of 100 times faster than a method that uses a generic optimizer. As an example, our method computes the control actions for a problem with 12 states, 3 controls, and horizon of 30 time steps (which entails solving a quadratic program with 450 variables and 1284 constraints) in around 5 ms, allowing MPC to be carried out at 200 Hz.}

Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied on multiple vehicles for the task of navigating through a cluttered environment.
