  abstract = {This book contains a derivation of the subset of stabilizing controllers for analog and digital linear time-invariant multivariable feedback control systems that insure stable system errors and stable controller outputs for persistent deterministic reference inputs that are trackable and for persistent deterministic disturbance inputs that are rejectable. For this subset of stabilizing controllers, the Wiener-Hopf methodology is then employed to obtain the optimal controller for which a quadratic performance measure is minimized. This is done for the completely general standard configuration and methods that enable the trading off of optimality for an improved stability margin and/or reduced sensitivity to plant model uncertainty are described. New and novel results on the optimal design of decoupled (non-interacting) systems are also presented.The results are applied in two examples: the one- and three-degree-of-freedom configurations. These demonstrate that thestandard configuration is one encompassing all possible feedback configurations. Each chapter is completed by a group of worked examples, which reveal additional insights and extensions of the theory presented in the chapter. Three of the examples illustrate the application of the theory to two physical cases: the depth and pitch control of a submarine and the control of a Rosenbrock process. In the latter case, designs with and without decoupling are compared.This book provides researchers and graduate students working in feedback control with a valuable reference for Wiener--Hopf theory of multivariable design. Basic knowledge of linear systems and matrix theory is required.},

The method is a modified version of Silverman's structure algorithm and is shown to be backward stable in a rigorous sense. The approach is shown to handle both nonsquare and/or degenerate systems. Several numerical examples are also provided.}

  abstract = {It is well known that all linear time-invariant controllable systems can be transformed to Brunovsky canonical form by a transformation consisting only of coordinate changes and linear feedback. However, the actual procedures for doing this have tended to be overly complex. The technique intorduced here is envisioned as an on-line procedure and is inspired by George Meyer's tangent model for nonlinear systems. The process utilizes Meyer's block triangular form as an intermediate step in going to Brunovsky form. The method also involves orthogonal matrices, thus eliminating the need for the computation of matrix inverses. In addition, the Kronecker indices can be computed as a by-product of this transformation so it is not necessary to know them in advance.}

  abstract = {A minimal basis of a vector space V of n-tuples of rational functions is defined as a polynomial basis such that the sum of the degrees of the basis n-tuples is minimum. Conditions for a matrix G to represent a minimal basis are derived. By imposing additional conditions on G we arrive at a minimal basis for V that is unique. We show how minimal bases can be used to factor a transfer function matrix G in the form \$G = ND{\textasciicircum}\{ - 1\} \$, where N and D are polynomial matrices that display the controllability indices of G and its controller canonical realization. Transfer function matrices G solving equations of the form \$PG = Q\$ are also obtained by this method; applications to the problem of finding minimal order inverse systems are given. Previous applications to convolutional coding theory are noted. This range of applications suggests that minimal basis ideas will be useful throughout the theory of multivariable linear systems. A restatement of these ideas in the language of valuation theory is given in an Appendix.}

  abstract = {This paper deals with further advances of the author's recent work on optimal design of control systems and Wiener filters. Specifically, we consider the problem of designing a system to control a plant when (1) not all state variables are measurable, (2) the measured state variables are contaminated with noise, and (3) there are random disturbances. An explicit design procedure (well adapted to digital computation) is presented. In addition, some fundamental new concepts (controllability, observability, etc.) are introduced. A general theory of control systems is outlined which answers many basic questions (what is controllable? why? how?) and gives a highly efficient method of computation. This paper is to be published in the Proceedings of the First IFAC Moscow Congress by Butterworth Scientific Publications in 1960.}

For this, the bond graph representation is used to visualize the paths of power flow and the energy interaction between the elements. In this graphical notation, the zeros disturb the power flow by introducing energy blocking nodes. As a consequence, some parts of the system are energetically isolated. Zeros are shown to be the eigenvalues of such isolated subsystems. The nodes also create constraints between some variables of the system. Rules are presented for identifying the zero-providing subsystems from bond graph models. The knowledge about these subsystems enable the designer to accurately devise the system structural configuration to obtain the most appropriate zeros.},
