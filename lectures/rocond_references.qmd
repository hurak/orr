The literature for $\mathcal H_\infty$ control is essentially identical to the one we gave in the previous chapter on analysis of robustness. In particular, we stick to our primary textbook @skogestadMultivariableFeedbackControl2005, in which the material is discussed in the forty-page Chapter 9. 

While discussing the analysis of robustness in the previous chapter, we omited discussion of *structured uncertainties* using the *structured singular values* (SSU, mu, $\mu$). Similarly here we did not delve into the extension of that framework towards control synthesis. Purely because of time constraints. But should you find some time, have a look at section 8.12, which discusses the methodology called $\mu$ synthesis.
