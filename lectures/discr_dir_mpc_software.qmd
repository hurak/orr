## QP solvers suitable for (linear) MPC

The extra features needed for MPC:

- warmstarting requires fesibility of the previous solution. Some methods the iterations may temporarily lose feasibility, which can be a problem if only a fixed number of iterations is allowed (in favor of predictable timing).
- ...

A curated list of QP solvers is maintained at [https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpbenchmark](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpbenchmark). Below are a few most popular from the open-source domain:
