In this treatise we present the rationale of H{$\infty$} control, give a brief history, and recall the milestones reached before our 2006 solution. We clarify why our novel approach is welcomed in the high-tech and aerospace industry.

Design characterizations of similar form as in the recent work on PID control, are derived for a larger class of compensators using simple geometric considerations. Specifically it is shown that, given the value of one parameter: i) the region of the plane defined by the other two parameters where the considered H/sub /spl infin// constraint is satisfied, consists of the union of disjoint convex sets whose number can be bounded by means of the pancake-cutting formula, and ii) the closed-loop pole distribution can be related to them.

In typical norm-based control designs, performance and robustness requirements are specified in a scalar optimization criterion, even for complex multivariable systems. This paper aims to develop a novel approach for the formulation of this optimization criterion for multivariable motion systems that exhibit spatio-temporal deformations. To achieve this, characteristics of the underlying system are exploited to design multivariable weighting functions. In contrast to pre-existing approaches, which typically lead to diagonal weighting functions, the proposed approach enables the design of non-diagonal weighting functions. Extensive experimental results confirm that the proposed procedure can significantly improve the performance of an industrial motion system compared to earlier approaches.}

From this polynomial {$\Delta$}({$\lambda$}) a polynomial {$\Delta$}*({$\lambda$}) can be constructed by complex conjugating the coefficients of {$\Delta$}({$\lambda$}) in order to form a polynomial which has real coefficients. When the coefficients are restricted to real coefficients, a simplification is provided that is particularly attractive since the Hurwitz stability of a convex combination of strict Hurwitz nth-degree polynomials requires the testing for the absence of zeros in the real interval (0, 1) of a polynomial of degree (n-1). A similar statement applies to a specialization of the results pertaining to Schur stability when the polynomial coefficients are real. This study, therefore, provides a unified approach for testing the Hurwitz or Schur stability of a convex combination of polynomials and generalizes earlier results to the complex coefficient case}

  abstract = {Nonsmooth variational analysis and related computational methods are powerful tools that can be effectively applied to identify local minimizers of nonconvex optimization problems arising in fixed-order controller design. We support this claim by applying nonsmooth analysis and methods to a challenging "Belgian chocolate" stabilization problem posed in 1994: find a stable, minimum phase, rational controller that stabilizes a specified second-order plant. Although easily stated, this particular problem remained unsolved until 2002, when a solution was found using an eleventh-order controller. Our computational methods find a stabilizing third-order controller without difficulty, suggesting explicit formulas for the controller and for the closed loop system, which has only one pole with multiplicity 5. Furthermore, our analytical techniques prove that this controller is locally optimal in the sense that there is no nearby controller with the same order for which the closed loop system has all its poles further left in the complex plane. Although the focus of the paper is stabilization, once a stabilizing controller is obtained, the same computational techniques can be used to optimize various measures of the closed loop system, including its complex stability radius or Hinfin performance}

We then develop a matrix version of an algorithm due to Schur for the construction of approximate realizations which produces (minimal degree) Nevanlinna--Pick approximants to the original positive real matrix. We further identify the normalized inverse of one of the outer factors of the approximant to the positive real matrix as the orthogonal projection of the identity onto a suitably defined subspace, give its interpretation as a reproducing kernel, and establish strong convergence under mild conditions on the growth of the order of the approximation. Finally we interpret and apply the mathematical theory developed in the body of the paper to the theory of prediction for vector-valued second order stationary stochastic sequences and briefly discuss connections with the theory of maximum entropy extensions and of inverse scattering.},

  abstract = {Research in robust control theory has been one of the most active areas of mainstream systems theory since the late 70s. This research activity has been at the confluence of dynamical systems theory, functional analysis, matrix analysis, numerical methods, complexity theory, and engineering applications. The discipline has involved interactions between diverse research groups including pure mathematicians, applied mathematicians, computer scientists and engineers. This research effort has produced a rather extensive set of approaches using a wide variety of mathematical techniques, and applications of robust control theory are spreading to areas as diverse as control of fluids, power networks, and the investigation of feddback mechanisms in biology. During the 90's the theory has seen major advances and achieved a new maturity, centered around the notion of convexity. The goal of this book is to give a graduate-level course on robust control theory that emphasizes these new developments, but at the same time conveys the main principles and ubiquitous tools at the heart of the subject. Its pedagogical objectives are to introduce a coherent and unified framework for studying robust control theory, to provide students with the control-theoretic background required to read and contribute to the research literature, and to present the main ideas and demonstrations of the major results of robust control theory. The book will be of value to mathematical researchers and computer scientists wishing to learn about robust control theory, graduate students planning to do research in the area, and engineering practitioners requiring advanced control techniques.},

After presenting the necessary results from the theories of Toeplitz operators and nest algebras, linear systems are defined as input-output operators and the relationship between stabilisation and the existence of co-prime factorisations is described. Uniform optimal control problems are formulated as model-matching problems and are reduced to four block problems, while robustness is considered both from the point of view of fractional representations and the "time varying gap" metric, as is the relationship between these types of uncertainties. The book closes with the solution of the orthogonal embedding problem for time-varying contractive systems. As such, this book is useful to both mathematicians and to control engineers.},

  abstract = {Recent decades have witnessed enormous strides in the field of robust control of dynamical systems ---~unfortunately, accounts of many of these developments are scattered in obscure research publications and accessible only to a small group of experts. In this highly regarded text for students and control engineers, the authors examine all of these advances, providing an in-depth examination of modern optimal and robust control.After a brief introductory chapter, the text proceeds to examinations of multivariable frequency response design, signals and systems, and linear fractional transformations and their role in control systems. Subsequent chapters develop the control system synthesis theory, beginning with a concise treatment of the linear quadratic Gaussian problem and advancing to full-information H-infinity~controller synthesis, the H-infinity filter, and the H-infinity~generalized regulator problem. Concluding chapters examine model reduction by truncation, optimal model reduction, and the four-block problem. The text concludes with a pair of design case studies and helpful appendices. This treatment requires familiarity with linear algebra, matrix theory, linear differential equations, classical control theory, and linear systems theory.},

The case with a structured dynamic perturbation is considered. This makes the problem a nontrivial generalization of a classical problem in the theory of dynamical systems. A solution to the robustness problem will be obtained by using a variational system obtained by linearizing the system dynamics along a trajectory, which is uncertain but within the prespecified neighborhood of the nominal trajectory. This gives rise to robustness conditions that can be solved using integral quadratic constraints for linear time periodic systems.}

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a generic notion of distance between systems that can be used to measure discrepancy between open-loop systems in a feedback sense under several uncertainty structures. When the uncertainty structure is chosen to be four-block (or equivalently, normalized coprime factor) uncertainty, then this generic distance measure reduces to the well-known nu-gap metric. Associated with this generic distance notion, we also define a generic stability margin notion that allows us to give the distance measure a feedback interpretation by deriving generic robust stability and robust performance results. The proposed distance notion and the corresponding results exploit a powerful generalization of the small-gain theorem which handles perturbations in RfrL infin, rather than only in RfrH infin. When the uncertainty structure is fixed to one of the standard structures (e.g., additive, multiplicative, inverse multiplicative, coprime factor, four-block or any mixtures of the above), we give a step-by-step procedure (based on model validation ideas) that shows how the generic notion of distance and the correspondingly generic winding number conditions can be reduced to simple formulae. This work provides a unified framework that captures and embeds previous results in this area and also completes the picture by showing how other results of a similar nature can be obtained from the same framework. The techniques used involve only basic linear algebra, so they also provide a simplification of previous advanced proofs. Furthermore, the various distance measures so created can be used for non-conservative model embedding into the smallest uncertain family. An illustrative example is also given that demonstrates the superior qualities, above the nu-gap metric, of a particular distance measure obtained from this work in situations where the plant is lightly-damped. All systems considered in this paper are linear time-invariant.}

Features of the text include:{$\cdot~~~~~~~~$} case studies that demonstrate the benefits of robust and adaptive control for piloted, autonomous and experimental aerial platforms;{$\cdot~~~~~~~~$} detailed background material for each chapter to motivate theoretical developments;{$\cdot~~~~~~~~$} realistic examples and simulation data illustrating key features of the methods described; and{$\cdot~~~~~~~~$} problem solutions for instructors and MATLAB{\textregistered} code provided electronically.~The theoretical content and practical applications reported address real-life aerospace problems, being based on numerous transitions of control-theoretic results into operational systems and airborne vehicles that are drawn from the authors' extensive professional experience with The Boeing Company. The systems covered are challenging, often open-loop unstable, with uncertainties in their dynamics, and thus requiring both persistently reliable control and the ability to track commands either from a pilot or a guidance computer.Readers are assumed to have a basic understanding of root locus, Bode diagrams, and Nyquist plots, as well as linear algebra, ordinary differential equations, and the use of state-space methods in analysis and modeling of dynamical systems.Robust and Adaptive Control is intended to methodically teach senior undergraduate and graduate students how to construct stable and predictable control algorithms for realistic industrial applications. Practicing engineers and academic researchers will also find the book of great instructional value.},

A pointwise-in-frequency weight optimization framework is transformed into convex optimization searches that are independent of frequency. The introduced optimization problem therefore avoids gridding of the frequency space and consequently, the inaccuracies attributed to fitting transfer functions to magnitude data. In this optimization problem, the order of the weight is specified `a priori', thus facilitating the synthesis of low-order controllers, which is desirable from an implementation perspective. The proposed solution algorithm simultaneously synthesizes a robust stabilizing controller and a loop-shaping weight (pre-compensator) that maximize the robust stability margin subject to constraints on the performance and the singular values of the weight. Three numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the technique.}

Along with a coherent introduction to the proposed control design and related topics, the monograph studies nonlinear affine control systems in the presence of uncertainty and presents a constructive and easily implementable control strategy that guarantees certain stability properties. The authors discuss linear-style feedback control synthesis in the context of the above-mentioned systems. The development and physical implementation of high-performance robust-feedback controllers that work in the absence of complete information is addressed, with numerous examples to illustrate how to apply the attractive ellipsoid method to mechanical and electromechanical systems. While theorems are proved systematically, the emphasis is on understanding and applying the theory to real-world situations. Attractive Ellipsoids in Robust Control will appeal to undergraduate and graduate students with a background in modern systems theory as well as researchers in the fields of control engineering and applied mathematics.},

Implied fundamental limits of feedback performance are quantitatively described and design tradeoffs are discussed. The penalty function in the stochastic linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) optimal control problem is found to be a weighted-sum of the singular values, with the weights determined by the quadratic cost and noise intensity matrices. This enables systematic "tuning" of LQG cost and noise matrices so that the resulting optimal return difference and inversereturn difference meet inequality constraints derived from design specifications on feedback properties. The theory has been used to synthesize a multivariable automatic controller for the longitudinal dynamics of an advanced fighter aircraft.}

This key observation is exploited to show that time-varying compensation does not improve the optimal rejection of disturbances, regardless of the norm used to measure the disturbances. Thus, absolutely summable, finite-energy, or persistent bounded disturbances may be treated in the same manner. It is shown that time-varying compensation does not help in the bounded-input bounded-output robust stabilization of time-invariant plants with unstructured uncertainty.
