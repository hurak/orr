While the indirect approaches to optimal control constitute the classical core of the optimal control theory, most treatments of the subject consider continuous-time systems. Our treatment was based on Chapter 2 in  [@lewisOptimalControl2012], which is one of a few resources that discuss discrete-time optimal control too.
