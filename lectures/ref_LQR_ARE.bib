The approach presented uses the generalized eigenproblem formulation for the solution of general forms of algebraic Riccati equations arising in both continuous- and discrete-time applications. These general forms result from control and filtering problems for systems in generalized (or implicit or descriptor) state space form. A Newtontype iterative refinement procedure for the generalized Riccati solution is given. The issue of numerical condition of the Riccati problem is addressed. Balancing to improve numerical condition is discussed. An overview of a software package, RICPACK, coded in portable, reliable Fortran is given. Results of numerical experiments are reported.}

It is the first book in which nonsymmetric algebraic Riccati equations are treated in a clear and systematic way. Some proofs of theoretical results have been simplified and a unified notation has been adopted.  Readers will find a discussion of doubling algorithms, which are effective in solving algebraic Riccati equations, and a detailed description of all classical and advanced algorithms for solving algebraic Riccati equations, along with their MATLAB{\textregistered} codes. This will help the reader gain understanding of the computational issues and provide ready-to-use implementation of the different solution techniques.  Audience: This book is intended for researchers who work in the design and analysis of algorithms and for practitioners who are solving problems in applications and need to understand the available algorithms and software. It is also intended for students with no expertise in this area who wish to approach this subject from a theoretical or computational point of view. The book can be used in a semester course on algebraic Riccati equations or as a reference in a course on advanced numerical linear algebra and applications.

We show that this is false. Questions of uniqueness of positive semidefinite solutions of the ARE are also unresolved in the absence of stabilizability. Yet fundamental performance issues in modern communications systems hinge on Kalman Filter performance absent stabilizability. In this paper we provide a positive semidefinite solution to the ARE for detectable systems that are not stabilizabile and show that it is unique if the only unreachable modes are on the unit circle.}

We first propose a model-based solution with cost minimization guarantees for states and inputs using dynamic programming (DP) that out-performs classical LQR with exogenous inputs. The control law consists of a combination of the optimal state feedback and an additional optimal term which is dependent on the exogenous inputs. The control gains for the two components are obtained by solving a set of matrix differential equations. We provide these solutions for both finite horizons and steady state cases. In the second part of the paper, we formulate a reinforcement learning (RL) based algorithm which does not need any model information except the input matrix, and can compute approximate steady-state extended LQR gains using measurements of the states, the control inputs, and the exogenous inputs. Both model-based and data-driven optimal control algorithms are tested with a numerical example under different exogenous inputs showcasing the effectiveness of the designs.},

For linear-quadratic control, this means that the solution of the Riccati equation must be obtained from backward integration from a final-time condition. These features are a direct consequence of the transversality conditions of optimal control, which imply that a free final state corresponds to a fixed final adjoint state [1], [2]. In addition, the principle of dynamic programming and the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is an inherently backward-propagating methodology [3].}
